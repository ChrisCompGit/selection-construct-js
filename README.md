# Lab 2 - Decision Making and Conditionals


## Question No.1
Develop a program that will prompt the user to enter his or her age and if the user’s age is less than or equal to 18, display the following message:

“You are too young to go beyond this point”.


## Question No.2
Modify Question 1 program so that if the person's age is greater than 18 years the program will print:

“You have been granted access”.


## Question No.3
Do the above question with a ternary operator.


## Question No.4
Develop a program that will receive two numbers from the keyboard.  Program should display to the screen the quotient of the two numbers.The quotient calculation (first number divided by the second number) is only to be performed if the second number does not equal zero. Display an appropriate error message if it is not.


## Question No.5
Develop a program that will prompt the user to enter an integer number and then display if the number entered by the user is a positive number or negative number.


## Question No.6
Develop a program that will prompt the user to enter a number and then display if the number is an odd or an even number.


## Question No.7
A student is given 3 tests, each marked out of 100. The student passes if their average mark is greater than or equal to 50 and fails if their average mark is less than 50.  Develop a program that will prompt the user for 3 marks and print “Pass” if the student passes and “Fail” if the student fails.


## Question No.8
A computer repair shop on Queen Street charges $100 for labour plus the cost of parts used to repair the device. However, **the minimum charge for any job is $150**. Write a program that will prompt the user for the number of hours  it took to report the device   and the cost of parts. Lastly, print the charge of the job. Do this question with an if else construct.


## Question No.9
Do the above program with an if construct instead of an if else.


## Question No.10
Do the above program with a ternary operator instead of an if else of an if block. 


## Question No.11
Develop a program which, when run, works as follows:

Hi, what's your name ? Input: Mr.Smith
Welcome to our show, Mr Smith
How old are you? Input: 52

Rules:

- If the person enters an age that is less than 1, we end the program and tell them this is not a valid age
- If the person enters a string then we also tell them that the value entered is not a valid age
- If the user is less than 22 years then they should not be allowed to continue the game and should be forced to exit the game
- Only if the user is 22 and above, we will give them a mamaguy age (-5 from their age) and continue with the program: 
    - Hmmmm, you don’t look a day over 47.
    - Tell me, Mr.Smith, how many cars do you own? 0
    - Wow, come on now Mr Smith, you are 47 and do not own a car!  
    - If the user owns a car or owns multiple cars then the rest of the program will work as follows:
        - Mr Smith, what is the brand and model of your car? Input: Nissan B14
        - The Nissan B14 is a great choice for a car.
        - Mr Smith, have a great day. Good Bye!!


## Question No.12
Develop a program that will read two numbers and an integer code from the keyboard. The value of the integer code MUST be 1, 2, 3 or 4.

- If the value of the code is 1, compute the sum of the two numbers.
- If the code is 2, compute the difference (first minus second).
- If the code is 3, compute the product of the two numbers. 
- If the code is 4, and the second number is not zero, compute the quotient (first divided by the second). 
- If the code is not equal to 1, 2, 3 or 4, display an error message.

The program then displays the two numbers, the integer code and the computed result on the screen.


## Question No.13
Redo the above question with a switch case construct.


## Question No.14
Develop a program which requests two weights in kilograms and grams and prints the sum of the weights. 

For example, if the weights are 3kg 500g and 4kg 700g , your program should print 8kg 200g.


## Question No.15
A home mortgage authority requires a deposit on a home loan according to the following schedule:
**Loan $**              **Deposit**
less than $25 000       5% of the loan value
$25 000–$49 999         $1250 + 10% of loan over $25 000
$50 000–$100 000        $5000 + 25% of loan over $50 000

Loans in excess of $100 000 are not allowed. Develop a program that will read Loan
amount and compute and print the required deposit.


## Question No.16
Design a program that will prompt an operator for a student name, number and the student's exam score out of 100. Your program is then to match the exam score to a letter grade and print the grade on the screen. Calculate the letter grade as follows:

90 and above   A
80–89.9        B
70–79.9        C
60–69.9        D
below 60       F


## Question No.17
Develop a program to read two pairs of integers. Each pair represents a fraction. For example, the pair 3 5 represents the fraction  3 / 5. Your program should then print the sum of the given fractions. 

For example, given the pairs of 3 5 and 2 3 , your program should print 19/15
3   +   2          =  19
5 	    3             15


## Question No.18
Modify the program so that it prints the sum of the fraction reduced as a mixed number. For example, your  19/15  should be converted to 1  4 /15


## Question No.19
All triangles have 3 sides and 3 angles which always add up to 180°. They are classified in two major ways that is:-
1. By the number of equal sides they have:
    - Scalene 
    - Isosceles  
    - Equilateral

1. By the types of angles they have:
    - Acute triangle 
    - Right triangle  
    - Obtuse triangle

You have been hired as a programmer by the Ministry of Education to develop a Java program for form 1 students. The said program should test students’ knowledge on the types of triangles, classified with regards to the number of equal sides they have. 

**The program that you are to develop MUST prompt the user for 5 Triangles (inclusive of their dimensions), then print the type of triangle each triangle conforms to (that is, Scalene,  Isosceles and Equilateral) and lastly print the number of times each triangle was entered.**

**Note, for each triangle you must prompt the user to enter all of its dimensions i.e., side 1, side 2 and side 3. Also, a valid triangle must have sides greater than 0. Thus, if the user enters any side that is not greater than 0 then the triangle would be invalid and your program must state such.**

Please see below for details with regards to Triangles that are classified according to the 
number of equal sides they have:-
1. **Equilateral triangle:** An equilateral triangle is a triangle that has three equal sides, thus all sides are equal to each other. The following is an equilateral triangle.
1. **Isosceles triangle:** An isosceles triangle is a triangle that has two equal sides, thus any two sides are equal to each other. The following is an isosceles triangle.
1. **Scalene triangle:** A scalene triangle is a triangle that has no equal sides thus; all sides are not equal to each other. The following is a scalene triangle.


## Question No.20
Always neat, always clean and always well attended, **Smith’s Laundromat** is the cleanest and nicest laundromat in the Diego Martin area, offering self-service and drop-off laundry services to both residential and commercial customers.
All their branches offer only state-of-the-art, environmentally conscious commercial grade washers and dryers. Their stores have Dexter front-loading washers with fast extraction spin in five sizes from 18 to 80 lbs., and high efficiency dryers, 30 to 80 lbs., so a customer never has to wait to finish their laundry.
As stated in the aforementioned, Smith’s Laundry Mart is known for providing impeccable service to their customers and as a result have a strong loyal customer base.  However, the company currently uses a manual system to issue bills and invoices to all their customers. Over time the said manual system has proven to be very problematic and has become an accounting nightmare as customers tend to get incorrect balances on their invoices and bills.
With the recent massive expansion in the business, both the President and the Financial Controller of the company noted that the aforementioned problems will rapidly deteriorate and thus, the need for a Program or Application to address and generate customer bills and invoices is highly critical. 
The proposed Program must incorporate the below requirements and business rules:

**Every customer is charged per pound (lb) based on the type of fabric clothing washed.**

See below for details:-
1. All Cotton Clothing that was washed incur a charge of $1.00 per lb
1. All Denim clothing that was washed incur a charge of $2.75 per lb.
1. Any other type of clothing  that was washed incur a charge of $0.65 per lb

Once washed, **ALL customers MUST dry their clothes at the company and as a result incur a Dryer charge. The Dryer charge varies based on the number of lbs of clothes washed.**

See below of details 
1. $2.50 per lb on ALL clothing if the number of lbs of clothes washed is between 1lb-7lb.
1. $1.50 per lb on ALL clothing if the number of lbs of clothes washed is more than 7lb to 12lb.
1. $0.55 per lb on ALL clothing if the number of lbs of clothes washed is more than 12lb.

**A customer balance is then calculated by adding the Cotton Fabric Clothing Charge to the Denim Clothing charge to the Other Type Clothing Charge to the Dryer Charge.**
*(Cotton Charge + Denim Clothing charge + Other Type Clothing Charge + Dryer Charge)*

Because Smith’s Laundry Mart is a V.A.T registered company, **VAT must be applied to all bills and invoices issued to any customer, which is 15% of the Customer balance.**

Lastly, **the customer Extended balance must be generated which is done by adding the Customer Balance to the V.A.T amount.**

You have been contracted as a programmer by Smith’s Laundromat to **develop a JavaScript program that will resolve the aforementioned issues.**

Your program **MUST** prompt the cashier to enter the following data for all customers: 

- **Customer’s first name**
- **Customer’s  last name**
- **The Number of lbs of Cotton fabric clothing that was washed.**
- **The number of lbs of Denim fabric clothing that was washed.**
- **The number of lbs of any other type of fabric clothing that was washed.**

Lastly, the program must output the customer bill which **MUST** list the following information: 

- **Customer Name**
- **The No of lbs and the charge of the Cotton fabric clothing that was washed.**
- **The No of lbs and the charge of  the Denim fabric clothing that was washed**
- **The No of lbs and the charge of the other types of fabric clothing that was washed.**
- **Dryer Charge**
- **Customer’s Balance**
- **VAT Amount**
- **Customer’s Extended Balance (Balance after VAT)**
